	* basic-c-compile.el: basic-c-compile-run-c now checks for an
	outfile with the extension set by
	basic-c-compile-outfile-extension.  Previously it was only
	checking for files with extension '.o'. A message letting the use
	know that the file has been update is now print as well.  Change
	commentary.
